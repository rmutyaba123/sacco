A board to help the admin track the recruitment process
Enable members who subscribe receive job recommendations based on their specific areas of interest.
Enable members, who have subscribed, invite friends.
Provide platform for  learning and career guidance to all members.This may include offering small course programs or providing links to best suited courses.(Training management)
Include a platform for members to view blog posts, news and also participate in discussions.
Research on ways to encourage/motivate members to actively participate.
