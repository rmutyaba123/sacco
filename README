Baraza is a Swahili word that means a deliberation meeting held by a collective group of a people of wisdom. The name baraza is used because the system came around by many heads with big minds coming together to develop it so as to come up with a working reliable system.

The Baraza Framework is a development Java Development initiative that makes application development easy. The framework takes advantage of XML to define its components. Using the framework, desktop applications, applets can be easily deployed using the same XML document with only slight modification.

Baraza is divided in three different blocks there is the Java code block, XML block and the Database block. The Java code block is again divided into four different blocks, that is; applet, servlet, server and IDE.

Baraza is a system that incorporates different independent projects that work independently using the same Java code block that uses the individual project XML block to produce a desired result. Feature of the baraza frame work:
- High development speed
- Low development cost
- Web enabled applications
- Very stable
- Well defined (well ordered design)
- Ease of operation (user friendly)
- Compatible with pc
